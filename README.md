# librarylink

A Windows utility that allows you to add PC Xbox (UWP) games, like via Game Pass, to Steam as non-Steam games. 

> [!NOTE]
> Steam overlay and Steam controller input are not supported. librarylink does not allow for running UWP apps on non-Windows platforms.

This app was developed as a toy project, so I don't intend to provide ongoing support. If you're interested in better-supported projects, check out [UWPHook](https://github.com/BrianLima/UWPHook) and [GlosSI](https://github.com/Alia5/GlosSI).

## Installation

### From Source

1. Ensure you have [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) installed
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dguenther/librarylink.git
   cd librarylink
   ```
3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```
4. The executable will be available at `target/release/librarylink.exe`

## Usage

### List Processes
```bash
librarylink processes
```
Lists all running Win32 processes with their Process IDs and executable paths.

### Launch UWP App
```bash
librarylink uwp-launch <App ID>
```
Launches a UWP application using its App ID (also called Application User Model ID) and monitors the process.

### Finding Game App IDs

To find the App ID for PC Xbox games, run the following command in PowerShell:

```powershell
Get-StartApps | Where-Object {$_.Name -match "*game name*"}
```

### Adding to Steam

1. Build or download `librarylink.exe`
2. In Steam, go to "Library" â†’ "Add a Non-Steam Game..."
3. Click "Browse" and select `librarylink.exe`
4. In the launch options, add: `uwp-launch <App ID>`
5. Rename the entry to match your game
6. (Optional) Add custom artwork and configure as needed

**Example Steam Launch Options:**
```
uwp-launch Microsoft.624F8B84B80_8wekyb3d8bbwe!Forzahorizon5
```
